# Assignment 03

For this assignment, use class `A03.java` in this folder, and complete the following methods:

* `countOf`,
* `findMax`,
* `findMin`, and
* `isPresent`

Starter code for each method is already available in `A03.java`. Also `A03.main` contains some simple testing code for your consideration.

If you want to look ahead at next week's assignment (Assignmet 04) that will be posted on 6/19 and will be due 6/26, notice that there are a couple more unfinished methods in `A03.java`.
